# Garbage-cleaning

Cleans up folders with temporary files and the specified folder (depending on the program). It only works with Windows. It happens that folders with temporary contents take up a lot of the necessary space, and this program solves this problem! It cleans up temporary folders from accumulated files and folders. Unfortunately or fortunately, it does not delete those files that interact with active programs, so be careful with this moment! I will be glad to add elements to the program that you suggest!
